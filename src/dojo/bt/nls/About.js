	"History_Para" : "Beyond Today was incorporated in the state of Texas in fall 2011.  Its first Board of Directors would convene later that same year.  We are a completely philanthropic organization, 100% volunteer, and have contributed over 5,000 pro-bono service hours to the greater Austin community. <br/><br/> From our inception, our focus has been upon peer support and recovery.  Through his volunteer work with Austin-area agencies such as Austin State Hospital, Austin Travis County Integral Care, and the Austin Clubhouse, founder and current Executive Director Adam Slosberg became deeply interested in these concepts &#8212; particularly, in how they might be expanded to support access by certain underserved, at-risk populations: non-English speakers, immigrants, and individuals navigating the criminal justice system. <br/><br/> Despite the fact that mental health issues affect an estimated 25% of U.S. adults, Texas ranks last among the states in per capita mental health care expenditure.  Gaps in services have prevented individuals from obtaining essential treatment and support, resulting in alarming rates of recidivism and re-hospitalization.  This not only hinders the health, happiness, and personal growth of individuals &#8212; it hinders the growth of communities.  Fortunately, stakeholders at all levels of the U.S. mental health system are becoming increasingly cognizant of the fact that peer support &#8212; as a cost-effective, evidence-based solution to this issue &#8212; may indeed hold the key to enduring recovery. <br/><br/> Almost immediately, Beyond Today began forming partnerships with mental health entities and professionals in the Austin area in order to sew up the gaps and establish a comprehensive network of client-recovery services for those experiencing mental health issues.  In October 2011, an art auction was held in support of NAMI Austin was held, attracting X individuals.  Relationships were pursued with Capital Area Counseling and Earnest Holistic Health, creating a readymade network of peer support, professional counseling, and nutritional services for the clients of Beyond Today.  Representatives of these organizations were incorporated into the Beyond Today Advisory Council, and were joined in 2012 by South Park Animal Hospital, a business attentive to the pet care needs of people in crisis.<br/><br/>In fall 2011, we also began providing peer support services to clients in both English and non-English speaking communities.  Beyond Today is currently the Austin area&#8217;s only provider of peer support services in Spanish and French.<br/><br/>In 2012, Beyond Today would continue to grow and change in response to the evolving needs of the community.  A needs assessment conducted in X revealed a strong lack of public awareness of the peer support and recovery concepts.  This resulted in the creation and implementation of Beyond Today&#8217;s Changing Minds educational outreach program.  On May 31, 2012, Beyond Today launched its first &#8220;Voices of Recovery&#8221; event, an open educational affair at Austin State Hospital focusing on the recovery experience.  The event drew over 120 participants, over 50% of whom were individuals with mental health issues.  It was held in part to commemorate the City of Austin&#8217;s first ever Mental Health Awareness Day, which Beyond Today was instrumental in bringing to pass through a proclamation of the City Council.<br/><br/> 2012 would also see Beyond Today&#8217;s increasing participation in conversations among stakeholders at the local, state, and federal levels on various mental health issues.  Foremost among these were discussions of the challenges facing individuals attempting to navigate the criminal justice system.  Major service gaps were identified, among which included a complete lack of peer support.  Beyond Today responded by spearheading the first Criminal Justice Coalition: a group of judges, attorneys, mental health professionals, and prison system personnel gathered to devise targeted solutions for identified needs.  The result of this work &#8212; a <u>Criminal Justice Pilot</u> set to launch in January 2013 &#8212; will seek to implement peer support services at various points within the system.",
